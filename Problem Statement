Problem statement
Minefield detection during the war is challenging with many uncertainties as detection is still
an evolving field. During the war, the commander must undertake a challenge to reach a
destination by avoiding detection and avoiding minefields using an optimal path. The
challenge is probabilistic and non-deterministic; complete knowledge is unavailable for the
minefield position. This changes drastically when technology is used to find mines. As part of
Make in India, a company has designed a low-budget Drone that uses customized acoustic
algorithms to detect mine cases and special chemical sensors to detect vapor leaks from
mines. However, the accuracy of the system is always at most 80%. The terrain to be
traversed can consist of open terrains, which the enemy can monitor, and large shrubs, which
can reduce the chances of detection.
You are approached to build an AI-based decision support system that can take the inputs
from the satellite (land terrain â€“ the probability of detection (PoD), drone ( probability of
mine (PoM) ), and from the commander to understand the level of risk he is willing to
undertake to reach the destination at the earliest. However, avoiding the minefield has the
highest priority, as the commander cannot risk his team by acting rashly.
Prove that your technique is correct for the case given as a maze problem when the fitness
f(n) of a given coordinate cell is given by:
Minimize(f(n))=[(1+PoD)(1+PoM)]
Apply the Random Restart Hill Climbing algorithm & Suggest the best solution obtained and
optimal cost so the commander can decide the best course of action. Interpret the observation
eg., on how many no.of.random restarts were used in your algorithm to get the global
optimum.
